Facilitating Semantic Interoperability of Trustworthy IoT Entities in Cultural Spaces: The Smart Museum Ontology.

Nowadays, cultural spaces (e.g., museums, archaeological sites) are interested in adding intelligence in their ecosystem by deploying different types of smart applications such as automated environmental monitoring, energy saving, and user experience optimization. Such an ecosystem is better realized through semantics in order to efficiently represent required knowledge for facilitating interoperability among different application domains, integration of data, and inferencing of new knowledge as insights to what may have not been observed with a  first "look".  This is our recent effort towards engineering an ontology for Smart Museums (SM), to meet the following objectives: a) represent  knowledge related to trustworthy IoT entities that 'live' and deployed in SM i.e., things, sensors, actuators, people, data, applications, b) deal with the semantic interoperability and integration of heterogeneous SM applications and data, c) represent knowledge related to museum visits and visitors towards enhancing their visiting experience, d) represent knowledge related to smart energy saving, e) represent knowledge related to the monitoring of environmental conditions in museums, and f) represent knowledge related to the space and location of exhibits and collections.
